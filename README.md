# COVID-19-Trends-and-Economic-Impact-in-Nigeria-2020-
This project analyzed COVID-19 case trends alongside economic factors like oil prices and reserves, highlighting key quarterly impacts and patterns.

The total confirmed cases for Nigeria in 2020 were 1,837, with 238 new cases reported. The highest surge in new cases occurred in March (162 cases).
 
There were only 2 recorded deaths, indicating a very low case fatality rate
 
Nigeria's contribution to global confirmed cases was negligible (highest at 0.23% in Q1).

Liquid reserves showed notable differences between Q1 (982 billion) and Q4 (106 billion).
 
The gross reserves remained relatively stable, totaling 1.433 billion naira, with slight variations across quarters.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS
 
Strengthen public health interventions during periods of high case surges, such as increased testing and vaccination drives, especially in months with historically high transmission rates.

Investigate and document the factors contributing to the low fatality rate, such as healthcare practices or demographic factors, and integrate these into health policies for future pandemics.
 
Maintain proactive public health measures like border control, public awareness campaigns, and testing to minimize Nigeria's global contribution to future outbreaks.
 
Develop robust reserve management policies to ensure liquidity is sufficient during prolonged crises.

Leverage reserves to provide economic relief during crises, such as funding health infrastructure and supporting businesses affected by lockdowns.
